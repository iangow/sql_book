# Preface {.unnumbered}

This "book" is a collection of notes made as I work through @tanimura2021sql.
An alternative title might have been "Data Analysis with Data Stored in Databases"; while SQL is the language used in @tanimura2021sql to do the analysis, this is in some ways a minor detail.
My view is that one can easy do "SQL" analysis using the `dplyr` package in R (this uses `dbplyr` behind the scenes ... mostly).
The `dplyr` package will quietly translate R code into SQL for the user.

An advantage of using `dplyr` rather than SQL directly is that one doesn't need to learn as much SQL.
In principle, one could use `dplyr` without knowing *any* SQL.
Given that `dplyr` and R can be used to analyse data from other data sources, this reduces the amount that is needed to be learnt to do analysis.
Additionally, one could write code to analyse data from a database and then easily reuse the code for data from a CSV file.

Notwithstanding the discussion in the previous paragraph, I recommend that people who find themselves using SQL-driven databases a lot learn some SQL.
This view is implicitly endorsed by Hadley Wickham with the inclusion of a significant amount of [material intended to teach SQL](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/databases.html) to readers of "R for Data Science".
While we include a brief primer on SQL for `dplyr` users [here](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/sql-primer.html), clearly an excellent source for learning SQL is @tanimura2021sql itself.

Another benefit of using R is that we can do more with R.
@tanimura2021sql includes many plots of data produced using SQL, but the code to make the plots is not included.
In contrast, here I will include code to produce the data as well as code to make plots (where applicable).

My view is that the material here might be useful to someone who is using @tanimura2021sql and wants to see how the ideas there can be implemented using R, while at the same time being useful to someone who knows (or is looking to learn) R and is looking for realistic data sets to work on.
