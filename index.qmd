# Preface {.unnumbered}

This "book" is a collection of notes made as I work through @tanimura2021sql.
An alternative title might have been "Data Analysis with Data Stored in Databases"; while SQL is the language used in @tanimura2021sql to do the analysis, this is in some ways a minor detail.
My view is that one can easy do "SQL" analysis using the `dplyr` package in R (this uses `dbplyr` behind the scenes ... mostly).
The `dplyr` package will quietly translate R code into SQL for the user.

An advantage of using `dplyr` rather than SQL directly is that one doesn't need to learn as much SQL.
In principle, one could use `dplyr` without knowing *any* SQL.
Given that `dplyr` and R can be used to analyse data from other data sources, this reduces the amount that is needed to be learnt to do analysis.
Additionally, one could write code to analyse data from a database and then easily reuse the code for data from a CSV file.

Notwithstanding the discussion in the previous paragraph, I recommend that people who find themselves using SQL-driven databases a lot learn some SQL.
This view is implicitly endorsed by Hadley Wickham with the inclusion of a significant amount of [material intended to teach SQL](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/databases.html) to readers of "R for Data Science".
While we include a brief primer on SQL for `dplyr` users [here](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/sql-primer.html), clearly an excellent source for learning SQL is @tanimura2021sql itself.

Another benefit of using R is that we can do more with R.
@tanimura2021sql includes many plots of data produced using SQL, but the code to make the plots is not included.
In contrast, here I will include code to produce the data as well as code to make plots (where applicable).

My view is that the material here might be useful to someone who is using @tanimura2021sql and wants to see how the ideas there can be implemented using R, while at the same time being useful to someone who knows (or is looking to learn) R and is looking for realistic data sets to work on.

## SQL and me

*Computer Information Systems I* was a required subject in my undergraduate degree program.^[Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Laws at the University of New South Wales.]
While I do not recall many of the details of the subject, I do recall a lecturer whose English was difficult to understand (I am not sure how many lectures I attended, as I thought at the time that lectures are a very inefficient way to learn ... as I still do) and a group project.

The group project required the construction of an SQL database for a hypothetical business.
My group comprised three people---myself, a good friend, and someone who was working full-time and studying a degree specializing in information systems.
I was a self-supporting full-time student, so I could not afford the software we used to build the database (my memory tells me it was about $60, but I know enough not to trust memories), but my friend had a copy.
I recall that some parts of the project were completed over the phone (this was before the internet), perhaps not the best way to write SQL.
In the end, I guess we got the project done and submitted.^[I vaguely recall getting a lower grade than my friend for the group assignment, which was inexplicable since there was no indication who did what. I survived.]

In any case, after that subject I continued on with the rest of my degree, but I don't think I used SQL or any data analysis tools except for Excel for the remainder of my Bachelor of Commerce (the Bachelor of Laws was free of quantitative analysis as far as I recall).

When I graduated I joined a "strategy consulting" firm.
My first project involved trying to explain the factors affecting branch profitability for a regional firm offering banking and insurance products.
I don't remember all the details, but there were many data analyses and some involved making requests for SQL queries to be run to supply the data that I used.

My second significant project involved analyses of product and customer profitability.
Again the details are hazy, but I recall that analyses required joining multiple tables involving data on mapping of products to cost centres, products to orders, orders to customers, and so on.
I would guess that I used Microsoft Access on a laptop that was underpowered (for its time).^[I recall that partners had the higher-powered laptops---necessary for writing Lotus Notes and reading Powerpoint slides---while analysts like me had older laptops.
It didn't make sense to me at the time, and still doesn't.]

A later project had a reputation that preceded it.
Several people had joined this project before deciding to leave the firm.
My recollection is that a partner had been hired from another firm with the understanding that he would lead an "insurance benchmarking study".
